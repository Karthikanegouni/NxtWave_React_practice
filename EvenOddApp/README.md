# EvenOddApp

A React class component app that displays a number and whether it is even or odd. On clicking the increment button, the number increases by a random value between 0 and 100, and the parity (Even/Odd) is updated accordingly using conditional rendering.

## Features

- Displays a count starting at 0
- Displays "Count is Even" or "Count is Odd" based on the value
- Clicking the button adds a random number (0â€“100) to the count
- Uses conditional rendering to show whether the count is even or odd
