# Counter App

This is a simple counter application built using React class components. It allows users to increase or decrease a numeric counter value. This project is part of my hands-on practice in the NxtWave MERN Stack Development Program.

## Features

- Display the current count
- Increase the count using the "Increase" button
- Decrease the count using the "Decrease" button
- Built using class-based components and `setState`
